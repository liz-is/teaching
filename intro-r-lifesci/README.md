# Introduction to R for Life Scientists

This workshop is directed toward life scientists with little to no experience with statistical computing or bioinformatics. This interactive workshop will introduce the R statistical computing environment, including basic instruction in data types, variables, array manipulation, functions, data frames, data import/export, visualization, and using packages. At the end of the workshop, participants will see a live demonstration of a real biomedical application - analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data. This will demo (1) how to acquire publicly accessible data from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, and (2) how to use Bioconductor packages to import, process, QC, analyze, and visualize the results of the analysis. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to use R for basic data manipulation and visualization, and will know where to look for further help and instruction. Participants will also be exposed to analyzing RNA-seq data. An advanced follow-on course will go through a gene expression data analysis in detail.

## Registration details

You must bring a laptop to the course. You'll need to download and install some (free) software and take a short pre-workshop survey before you can register. Here's how it works:

0. First, download and install the software as described below. Run the code provided. Doing this successfully will reveal a link to take the pre-workshop survey.
0. Next, go to the link to take the pre-workshop survey. It's short - should take you less than one minute. Completing the survey will reveal the actual registration link.
0. Go to this link and register.

If you have any trouble registering, please don't hesitate to [email me](http://stephenturner.us/email).

### Software setup

0. [Click this link to download and a zip file of this repository](https://github.com/stephenturner/teaching/archive/master.zip), then extract it somewhere on your computer (e.g. your Desktop). It has the data you'll need to go through these examples.
0. Download and install R for [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [Mac OS X](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) (download the R-3.x.x.pkg file for your appropriate version of OS X).
0. Download and install RStudio Desktop: <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop>.
0. Launch RStudio. Ensure that you have internet access, then enter the following commands into the **Console** panel (usually the lower-left panel, by default). Note that these commands are case-sensitive.
  * The first 4 commands will download and install necessary add-on packages we will use in class. If anything asks you to update, type "a" and hit enter at the prompt to update all packages.
  * The second 4 commands will install a package I wrote, and runs a function that will display the link to take the survey.

```coffee
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
biocLite("Biobase")
biocLite("DESeq2")

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("stephenturner/Tmisc")
registration()
```

### Take the pre-workshop survey

Successfully running the commands above will reveal a link to take a pre-workshop survey. This survey should take about one minute to complete. After you submit the survey you'll get a link to register.
